ðŸ”¹ Beginner to Intermediate Level
#	Question
1	Write a C# program to find the second largest element in an integer array.
2	Write a function to reverse an array without using any inbuilt methods.
3	Implement a method to remove duplicates from an array without using List<>.
4	Given an array, check if it is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
5	Write a C# program to rotate the array to the left by k steps.
6	Write a method that returns maximum sum of a subarray (Kadaneâ€™s algorithm).
7	Given an array of numbers, find all pairs with a given sum (e.g., sum = 10).

ðŸ”¹ Advanced / Tricky Logic
#	Question
8	Given an integer array, find the first missing positive integer (e.g., for [3, 4, -1, 1] â†’ 2).
9	Without sorting, check whether an array contains consecutive elements (unique).
10	Implement a program to find the majority element (element that appears more than n/2 times).
11	You are given an array of n-1 integers from 1 to n, find the missing number.
12	Implement a C# function to find the equilibrium index (sum of left == sum of right).
13	Given a binary array (0s and 1s), find the maximum number of consecutive 1s.
14	You are given an array of positive numbers. Find the minimum number of swaps required to bring all elements less than or equal to k together.
15	Given an array, return true if the array contains a duplicate within k indices.

ðŸ”¹ Bonus: Puzzle-like Logical Problems
#	Question
16	You have an array of size n, where all numbers appear even number of times, except one number which appears odd times. Find that number.
17	In an array of integers, find all triplets such that a + b + c = 0.
18	Write a program to flatten a 2D array to a 1D array.
19	Rotate a square matrix (2D array) by 90 degrees in-place.
20	Implement a C# method to check whether a given array can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum.
